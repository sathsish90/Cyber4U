- Interesting Terminologies
  - Vulnerability: A vulnerability refers to a weakness or flaw in a system's design, implementation, or operation that could be exploited to compromise the system's security. It represents a potential entry point for attackers and Often describing weaknesses or gaps in security measures that could be exploited by malicious actors.
  - Payload: In the context of cyber security, a payload is a piece of code or software that is delivered to and executed on a target system. It is designed to carry out a specific action, often with malicious intent, once activated.
  - Exploit: An exploit is a technique or method used to take advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a system. It is typically employed to compromise the security of the target system and gain unauthorized access or control.
  - Vulnerability Assessment: Vulnerability assessment involves systematically identifying, analyzing, and quantifying vulnerabilities in a system or network. The goal is to evaluate the security posture and provide insights into potential risks. It often includes processes like scanning, penetration testing, and risk analysis.
  - Penetration Testing: Penetration testing, or pen testing, is a simulated cyber attack on a system, network, or application to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. The purpose is to assess the security posture and evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures.
  - Security Audit: A security audit is a systematic evaluation of an organization's information systems, policies, and procedures. It aims to ensure that security controls are implemented effectively and that the organization is compliant with relevant security standards.
  - Threat Vector: A threat vector is a path or means by which a threat actor can gain access to a target system. It encompasses the methods and channels used to deliver a cyber threat.
  - Zero-Day Exploit: A zero-day exploit targets a previously unknown vulnerability in a system, application, or software. It takes advantage of the fact that there are zero days of protection against this newly discovered vulnerability.

## Real Faces of Cyber Security Jobs Count-

- How can you know how many security jobs there are if thereâ€™s no real statistical data available?
- Are there truly enough security jobs and how accurate are the current statistics?

## Introduction

Well-publicized estimates of a massive shortfall in cybersecurity workers have resulted in high expectations among job seekers in the field, but the reality often falls flat due to a mismatch between companies' requirements and job seekers' skill sets. This situation makes me wonder: Is there really a shortage of cybersecurity workers that will keep causing problems for companies in 2024, or is this issue more about the changing job market, companies expecting too much, and the need for workers with new skills?

## Cyber Employment 2024

### Job Market Realities

- **Expectation vs. Reality**: While companies express their struggles in hiring knowledgeable cybersecurity professionals, pointing to a shortfall of nearly a half-million workers, job seekers argue that the expectations set by employers are often unrealistic and do not align with the realities of the job market.
- **Education and Experience Mismatch**: A significant number of job postings demand at least a bachelor's degree and several years of experience. This requirement overlooks a large pool of talented individuals who might not have traditional educational backgrounds but possess valuable skills and potential.
- **The Mercenaries**: A small subset of cybersecurity job seekers, often referred to as 'mercenaries', with the right blend of education, technical skills, credentials, and professional network, find it relatively easy to secure positions. This starkly contrasts with the majority who struggle to meet the stringent demands of employers.

### Challenges for Job Seekers

- **Unreasonable Expectations**: Many job seekers are deterred by the lengthy and often convoluted interview processes, coupled with a perceived lack of commitment from companies to invest in training and professional development.
- **Salary Concerns**: Despite the critical nature of cybersecurity roles, many companies are reluctant to offer competitive salaries, contributing to the reluctance of skilled professionals to apply for or accept these positions.

### Certification and Experience Paradox

- **Certification Requirements**: The industry paradox where many sought-after cybersecurity certifications demand extensive prior work experience, while a significant portion of the job market, purportedly requiring these certifications, is aimed at entry-level, lower-paid positions.

## Understanding the Shortage

This section delves into what constitutes a shortage and how it's perceived differently by employers and job seekers.

### Economic Impacts

- **Budget Tightening**: Exploring how economic factors like high interest and inflation are influencing companies' decisions regarding their cybersecurity departments and overall security posture.
- **Strategic Value of Cybersecurity**: Advocating for a deeper understanding among corporate leaders of the strategic importance of cybersecurity, beyond its perception as a cost center.

### Demand for Cybersecurity Workers

- Discussing how, despite economic and market challenges, the ever-increasing cyber threat landscape and the critical nature of digital security might continue to drive strong demand for cybersecurity workers in 2024 and beyond.

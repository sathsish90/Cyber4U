Beginning with programming is the initial step in delving into the realm of security. Numerous languages are available, with Python being the most widely chosen, given its simplicity and popularity. PHP and Go, although less favored for security-related tasks, are still viable options. Bash and Powershell, primarily employed for scripting and creating straightforward CLI applications, serve different purposes.

Given the distinct characteristics of programming languages, it's crucial to understand their workings and align them with your learning objectives. For instance, C++ and Java involve compilation, while PHP and Python are interpreted languages. This distinction significantly influences their practical applications. Moreover, each language incorporates its unique design patterns.

# Difference between hacking and ethical hacking

- **Hacking:** Unauthorized access or manipulation for malicious purposes, like breaking into someone's computer without permission – akin to breaking into a house.
- **Ethical Hacking:** Authorized testing of systems for security weaknesses to strengthen defenses, like a security expert checking a door's lock to ensure it can't be easily breached.

# Difference between hacking and ethical hacking

- **Hacking:** Unauthorized access or manipulation for malicious purposes, like breaking into someone's computer without permission – akin to breaking into a house.
- **Ethical Hacking:** Authorized testing of systems for security weaknesses to strengthen defenses, like a security expert checking a door's lock to ensure it can't be easily breached.

Programming Language [Scripting]
====================

- History of technologies
- Why the programming language came?
- What problem it is solving?
- Organization based languages (Like hack (facebook), Gscript (Guidewire) etc.,)

Beginning with programming is the initial step in delving into the realm of security. Numerous languages are available, with Python being the most widely chosen, given its simplicity and popularity. PHP and Go, although less favored for security-related tasks, are still viable options. Bash and Powershell, primarily employed for scripting and creating straightforward CLI applications, serve different purposes.

Given the distinct characteristics of programming languages, it's crucial to understand their workings and align them with your learning objectives. For instance, C++ and Java involve compilation, while PHP and Python are interpreted languages. This distinction significantly influences their practical applications. Moreover, each language incorporates its unique design patterns.
